        <p className="mb-3">
          Our ratings are crowd-sourced from real users with allergies who have visited these venues. 
          Each rating reflects their personal experience with allergen safety at that location.

        <p className="mb-3">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Ratings are subjective and based on individual experiences. 
          Always inform restaurant staff about your allergies and ask about ingredients and preparation methods.

          We recommend using TrustDiner as a starting point for research, not as a substitute for 
          direct communication with restaurant staff about your specific needs.
